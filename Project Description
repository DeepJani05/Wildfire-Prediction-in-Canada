The wildfire prediction project addresses Canada's escalating fire challenges through advanced machine learning models. Developed by a team of researchers (Deep Jani, Svapnilsinh Solanki, and Charitarth Antala), the project aims to forecast wildfire occurrences, spread, and air quality impacts using comprehensive climate and ecological datasets.
Key highlights include:

Analyzing the unprecedented 2023 fire season that burned approximately 18.5 million hectares
Utilizing multiple machine learning techniques (Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, XGBoost)
Integrating climate data to provide early warnings and support resource allocation
Assessing public health risks from wildfire smoke
Developing predictive models to mitigate climate change impacts on ecosystems

The project's significance lies in its innovative approach to understanding and predicting wildfire risks. It offers critical insights for fire management agencies and public health authorities. By combining technical innovation with practical application, the research contributes to building resilience against increasingly severe wildfire challenges in Canada.

The project utilizes three main machine-learning models for wildfire prediction:

Random Forest Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regressor

These models were chosen for their ability to handle complex, non-linear data and their proven performance in wildfire forecasting applications.

The project incorporates several key features and techniques:

Feature engineering:

Creation of a 'SEASON' feature based on the date of burn (DOB)
Development of a 'FIRE_RISK_INDEX' using temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity

Data preprocessing:

Handling missing values by filling with mean values
Encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding

Model evaluation metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
R-squared (R2) score

Cross-validation to ensure model robustness and generalizability

Feature importance analysis to identify the most significant factors contributing to wildfire risks
The project references the unprecedented 2023 wildfire season in Canada, which burned approximately 18.5 million hectares, as a case study highlighting the urgent need for improved predictive strategies
