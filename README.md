# Wildfire-Prediction-in-Canada
The wildfire prediction project addresses Canada's escalating fire challenges through advanced machine learning models

Project Overview
This project addresses Canada's escalating wildfire challenges through advanced machine learning models. Developed by a team of researchers, it analyzes comprehensive climate and ecological datasets to forecast wildfire occurrences and impacts. The 2023 fire season, which burned approximately 18.5 million hectares, underscores the urgent need for predictive strategies.

Objectives

Forecast wildfire occurrences and spread
Assess impact on air quality
Provide early warnings for effective resource allocation and risk mitigation

Methodology
The project utilizes multiple machine learning techniques:
Random Forests
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
XGBoost

Dataset
The analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset containing:
Historical climate data
Fire records
Ecological information

Key Features
Feature engineering (e.g., 'SEASON', 'FIRE_RISK_INDEX')
Model comparison and evaluation
Cross-validation for robust performance
Feature importance analysis

Results
Performance metrics for each model include:
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
R-squared (R2) score

Installation and Usage
